## Inspiration
I originally wanted to build something centered around **women's health**, but with limited knowledge of AI/ML, I explored using **APIs** instead. Being a solo participant, managing everything myself was a bit overwhelming. And then—right during one of my own **period mood swings**—the idea clicked. I thought: *What if an app could understand your mood and respond with something fun, comforting, or uplifting?*  
That's how **MooDiva** was born.

## What it does
MooDiva takes in your current mood (like “happy,” “sad,” “motivated,” etc.), runs a **mood analysis**, and gives back a playful or quirky response. Along with that, it offers:

- 🎵 A **playlist** to match your vibe  
- 💬 **Fun or comforting advice**  
- 🎯 A list of suggested **activities** you could try while in that mood

## How we built it

I built MooDiva using:

- 🛠️ **React**, **JSX**, and **CSS**
- 🤖 Help from **ChatGPT** to overcome challenges and build features
- 🤝 Integrated **Google Gemini API** to handle mood analysis and personalized suggestions

## Challenges we ran into
### 1. Technical Barriers  
While integrating Google Gemini API, I ran into multiple errors. Eventually, I **exhausted the free quota**, and to avoid any **accidental billing**, I created and switched to a **mock API** I coded myself.  
I plan to revisit Gemini integration once I get access to a new quota.

### 2. Solo Journey in My First Hackathon  
This was my **first hackathon**, and I had to manage everything alone—**frontend, backend(i did not add it), design, logic**.  
I only had **partial knowledge of React** and coding in general.  
I also missed accessing the team-help channels like server support, and **academic commitments** limited my time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Despite the hurdles, I managed to bring my idea to life—**not perfectly**, but **meaningfully**.  
**MooDiva** reflects what I truly wanted to build, and I'm proud I made it **functional and expressive all by myself**.


## What we learned

- 🧠 Built a **complete React app** for the first time  
- 🤝 Learned how to **integrate Gemini AI** into a real-world use case  
- 💪 Gained confidence working with **APIs**, prompts, and app structure

## What's next for MooDiva
- 🔌 Fully integrate the Gemini API once quota access is available  
- 🎧 Build an **in-app music player** for a seamless playlist experience  
- 📺 Embed **video players** and **activity resources** right inside the app  
- 🎨 Redesign the **UI** for a cleaner and more expressive feel  
- 📝 Possibly explore deeper features like **journaling** or **AI chat**
